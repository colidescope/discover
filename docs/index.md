Discover is a free, open-source optimization framework built to work with Rhino Grasshopper. The included solver is based on the [NSGA-II](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017) genetic algorithm but is written in a modular fashion so it can be extended with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms in the future. Although it can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems, it is specifically tailed to physical design problems. For problem representation it relies on [McNeel's Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) and the plugin [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/), one of the most popular tools for computational design in industry. Connection to Grasshopper is handled by a special set of components which are included with this package.
