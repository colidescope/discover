Discover is a free optimization tool built to work with [Rhino](https://rhino3d.com) [Grasshopper](http://grasshopper3d.com). It is being developed in conjunction with the [Generative Design](https://performance.thinkific.com/courses/generative-design-course?ref=a6f24f) course on [Performance Network](https://performance.thinkific.com/?ref=a6f24f). 

## Requirements

- PC running Windows 10 64-bit
- [Rhino 6](https://www.rhino3d.com/download) - Discover can probably be made to work with Rhino 5 as well as the OSX version but it is not supported at this time.
- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
- Web browser (such as [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/b/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/))

## Intallation

### Installing Python

Currently Windows does not ship with Python, so if you've never used Python or you're not sure, you will need to install a version of Python on your computer. Discover currently supports Python 3.7, which is the latest version at the time of writing. If you'd like to use Python 2 it can probably be made to work but it is not supported at this time. If you already have Python installed you can skip to the next step.

1. Go to the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and select the latest Python 3 release ([3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/) at time of writing).
2. On the download page, scroll down and under 'Files' select and download the [`Windows x86-64 executable installer`](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-amd64.exe). 
3. Run the .exe installation file to install Python on your computer.
