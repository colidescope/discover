Discover is a free, open-source optimization framework built to integrate with [Rhino](https://rhino3d.com) [Grasshopper](http://grasshopper3d.com). The included solver is based on the [NSGA-II](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017) genetic algorithm but is written in a modular fashion so it can be extended with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms in the future. Although it can be used to solve a variety of optimization problems, Discover is specifically geared to physical design problems in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries.
